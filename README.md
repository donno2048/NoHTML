[Demo](https://nohtmlatall.herokuapp.com/)

This is a website with absolutely no HTML source which can render HTML (and images, using box-shadowing as shown in [the :octocat: branch](https://github.com/donno2048/NoHTML/tree/octocat)),

yeah, you read it right, this website has no HTML but can render HTML.

If you right-click on the website and choose `View page source` you will see nothing, even though anything in _index.html_ will be displayed on the page.
